# go-http-from-scratch

A learning project where I implement a minimal HTTP server in **Go**, starting from raw **TCP sockets** instead of relying on Go’s built-in `net/http` package.
The goal is to deeply understand how HTTP works at the protocol level and how data flows between a client and a server over the network.

## 🚀 Motivation

Most Go developers rely on `net/http` for building servers, but that abstracts away a lot of the lower-level details.
This project is my attempt to peel back the layers and learn:

- How TCP connections are established and handled
- How HTTP requests are structured and parsed
- How to construct and send valid HTTP responses
- How concurrency plays a role in handling multiple client requests

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand the **TCP protocol** in Go
- Parse **HTTP request lines, headers, and bodies**
- Write minimal but correct **HTTP response messages**
- Experiment with **concurrency (goroutines)** for handling multiple clients
- Build a deeper intuition for how modern web servers work under the hood

## 🛠 Features (Planned)

- [x] Open a TCP socket and listen for connections
- [x] Accept multiple client requests
- [ ] Parse HTTP request lines (method, path, version)
- [ ] Parse request headers
- [ ] Respond with a minimal HTTP response
- [ ] Support basic routes (e.g., `/`, `/about`)
- [ ] Graceful shutdown and logging
